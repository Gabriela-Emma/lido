"staking","**Staking**     Not everyone who wants to participate in the Cardano ecosystem can run and maintain a computer server. This is where staking comes in: you can delegate your ADA to a pool. Then, when that pool gets rewarded, you get paid too, proportional to the amount of your stake. This is like interest earned in a traditional bank savings account. While the bank holds your money, they are putting it to work by loaning it out to others, and collecting interest. So you earn a (teeny tiny!) cut of that return in the form of interest on your savings. With staking, you are letting your investment work for you. Unlike traditional banking, everyone decides the rules of the ecosystem, not a few. So, the returns are more inspiring and fair than what you would get at the bank.","what is staking","App\Models\Snippet",4,"published"

"the stake pools","**The Pools**    Cardano achieves trustless shared security and responsibility by encouraging a robust network of participants. Why would a pool operator want to do the work of maintaining a pool in the network? Because there’s money in it, of course! About every five days, **pools that perform their job for the blockchain, receive a certain amount of ADA as a reward.**","what is staking","App\Models\Snippet",3,"published"
"the staking network","**The Network**   The Cardano “Network” is just that: a network of connected computer nodes. Each node is maintained by a stake pool operator. When there are transactions on the network, a random pool is selected to scoop up a bunch of these transactions, validate them, put them in a block, then update their copy of the global blockchain database. Next, every other computer on the network processes and confirms and download the update. Sharing responsibilities removes the need to trust a central bank or government.    Since every node has a its own copy of the blockchain, it’s impossible for one node to add records that everyone didn’t agree to. No one can claim money they are not entitled to; fraudulent transactions are rejected by the rest of the network forcing the random chosen pool to play by the rules.","what is staking","App\Models\Snippet",2,"published"

"cardano-money","**Money**   Cardano has a digital currency called ADA. You can use ADA to buy food and services where accepted. You can also trade ADA for local currency, as you might exchange US Dollars for Euros.

Both innovations created vast amounts of new wealth, for new people. This forced society to change how we live and govern.

"Cardano in the World","**Cardano in the World**   Beyond these few examples, Cardano is what we make of it. It’s like Windows without Microsoft or iPhones without Apple. It’s a public utility, like the internet, or radio waves. The difference is that with Cardano, everyone can have a say in how the system works.  **Greece** is running an experiment with storing their diplomas on the Cardano blockchain.  **Ethiopia** is launching a new pilot system built on Cardano for 5 million of its citizens.  You can lobby your student or local government to move record-keeping to Cardano. You can use a drag and drop builder to create escrows, swaps, bonds, and financial contracts without coding knowledge!","what is cardano","App\Models\Snippet",6,"published"
"Invest in ADA","If you invest in Cardano and choose not to stake, it’s a bit like hiding your savings under the mattress. In fact it is worse! The exchange where your ADA resides is actually staking it for you – and keeping 100% of the rewards. Nor should you stake on an exchange. In these cases, the exchange is still the big winner. They control the choice of available pools, and the fees they collect are higher.  **Choose a pool you believe in to maximize your returns and support the network**","what is staking","App\Models\Snippet",6,"published"
"pool-rewards","**Rewards**   When our pool is fully funded, delegators earn rewards every five days, automatically.    Unlike other networks where pool operators are in charge of meting out rewards, **the Cardano staking reward system is fully automated and trustless**. Rewards come directly from Cardano into your wallet. You are in control every step of the way.    When Lido Nation mints a block on the chain, you will receive rewards in your wallet at the end of the 5-day epoch.    **Rewards are expected to be about 5% annually.**","global","App\Models\Snippet",0,"published"

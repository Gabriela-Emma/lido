### How much does it cost to publish an article on Lido Nation?

We don’t offer article spots for sale. If your content is educational, accurate, interesting, and on-topic, we will likely be interested in publishing your content. Feel free to share a topic, outline, or full article that you are interested in publishing and we can let you know if it’s a fit for Lido Nation.

### How much can I get paid for writing for LidoNation?

At this time, our content work is not monetized. We don’t get paid to do it, and we don’t have a budget to pay guest writers. We publish new educational content every week because we think it’s important. We believe that blockchain has the potential to transform the future, but only if people know about it. We want to be a positive change agent in shaping that future. If you share these values and have something to share with the world, we’d love to publish content with you.

In the past, we have won funding for some content work through Project Catalyst, and it’s possible that we will apply for similar funding in the future. If you are interested in ongoing work publishing content with Lido Nation, let’s talk about partnering up on a funding proposal!

### What topics can I write about for Lido Nation?

This is an incomplete list of topics we might be interested in. If you have an idea that doesn’t fit here, just get in touch!

We publish articles about:
- Blockchain technology
- Cardano especially, but other interesting blockchains too
- People, projects, and DApps in the Blockchain and Web3 space
- News about Cardano, blockchain, or Web 3.
- Reviews of products and projects
- Summaries, insights, or reflections taken from blockchain events, presentations, Twitter Spaces, public Zoom meetings, or books.

Check out the Category and Tags sections on the [Library](https://www.lidonation.com/en/library) page for a complete overview of our content topics.

### Are there any topics that are off-limits?
We specialize in hype-free, educational content.

While references to crypto prices and price movement are not strictly off-limits, it’s in the danger zone. A factual price note might be relevant, but price speculation and hype is a no-no.

We do not offer financial advice. Anything with a “get rich quick” vibe is probably not our cup of tea.

We welcome content about your own work or projects, especially if you can teach us something while you’re at it. Whether writing about your own or someone else’s project, we will want to validate that the project is reputable.

We reserve veto power, and will not publish any content that doesn’t fit with our ethos.

### Do you have a list of topics you need a writer for?

Not really. We have found the list of great article ideas is endless and ever-changing. Current events and cutting edge technology move fast! You should write about what you are passionate and knowledgeable about.

### I’m not sure if my content is good enough?

If you are interested in publishing content at Lido but need help with formatting, editing, fact-checking or other details, get in touch! We work as a team to edit and improve each other’s work, and we would work with you in the same way, as needed.

### How can I get started?
If you have a topic, an outline, or a draft of an article, just send it over - hello@lidonation.com
We will get back to you within a week.

If we like it, we will work with you to edit and publish with your byline and your links. If you have an original image you want to use, we can do that, otherwise we can work with you to create custom original art for your article.

If we don’t think it’s a good fit, we will let you know why, and what changes would be needed for us to consider it.

We will never steal your stuff or rip off your ideas.

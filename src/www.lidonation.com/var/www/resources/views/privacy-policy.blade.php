### Use of Cookies
The LIDO Nation website may use "cookies" to help you personalize your online experience. A cookie is a text
file that is placed on your hard disk by a web page server. Cookies cannot be used to run programs or
deliver viruses to your computer. Cookies are uniquely assigned to you, and can only be read by a web server
in the domain that issued the cookie to you.

One of the primary purposes of cookies is to provide a convenience feature to save you time. The purpose of
a cookie is to tell the Web server that you have returned to a specific page. For example, if you
personalize LIDO Nation pages, or register with LIDO Nation site or services, a cookie helps LIDO Nation to
recall your specific information on subsequent visits. This simplifies the process of recording your
personal information, such as billing addresses, shipping addresses, and so on. When you return to the same
LIDO Nation website, the information you previously provided can be retrieved, so you can easily use the
LIDO Nation features that you customized.

You have the ability to accept or decline cookies. Most Web browsers automatically accept cookies, but you
can usually modify your browser setting to decline cookies if you prefer. If you choose to decline cookies,
you may not be able to fully experience the interactive features of the LIDO Nation services or websites you
visit.

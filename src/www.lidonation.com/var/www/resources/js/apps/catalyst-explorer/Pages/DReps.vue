                                The Cardano community's Project Catalyst fund
                                has experienced remarkable growth since its
                                inception, with Fund8 receiving nearly 1,000
                                proposals. This expansion, while positive, poses
                                a challenge as it increases the community's
                                responsibility to review and vote on an
                                ever-growing number of proposals. To address
                                this challenge and ensure the sustainability of
                                Project Catalyst, a new system of delegation is
                                being introduced.

                                Delegation allows ADA holders to entrust their
                                voting power to one or more Delegate
                                Representatives (dReps). This system empowers
                                passive voters, enabling them to have their
                                voices heard across a broader range of proposals
                                than they could personally evaluate. dReps will
                                play a crucial role in Project Catalyst by
                                voting on the majority of proposals, enhancing
                                decision-making quality within each Fund.

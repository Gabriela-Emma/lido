                        Project Catalyst's Continued Growth and the Need for
                        Delegation
                    </p>

                    <p class="text-xl font-light leading-relaxed tracking-wide">
                        The Cardano community's Project Catalyst fund has
                        experienced remarkable growth since its inception, with
                        Fund8 receiving nearly 1,000 proposals. This expansion,
                        while positive, poses a challenge as it increases the
                        community's responsibility to review and vote on an
                        ever-growing number of proposals. To address this
                        challenge and ensure the sustainability of Project
                        Catalyst, a new system of delegation is being
                        introduced.

                        Empowering Passive Voters through Delegation
                    </p>

                    <p class="text-xl font-light leading-relaxed tracking-wide">
                        Delegation allows ADA holders to entrust their voting
                        power to one or more Delegate Representatives (dReps).
                        This system empowers passive voters, enabling them to
                        have their voices heard across a broader range of
                        proposals than they could personally evaluate. dReps
                        will play a crucial role in Project Catalyst by voting
                        on the majority of proposals, enhancing decision-making
                        quality within each Fund.

                        IOG is reopening the application process for the first
                        dRep cohort, emphasizing inclusivity and diversity. This
                        move aims to ensure that the dRep community represents
                        the wider Cardano community's diverse perspectives and
                        expertise. As Project Catalyst continues to evolve, the
                        introduction of dReps marks a significant step forward
                        in ensuring the fund's sustainability and effectiveness.
